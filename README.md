Processing program that takes input from specified text file. Parses text and displays in window for user to view. The color of the word is dependent on the frequency in which it appears (the darker the word, the higher the frequency). Default color is purple :) 

To execute program, download folder 'WordFreq.windows32', modify "UserInput.txt" to contain desired text, and execute.
Ensure that UserInput.txt is in the same location as WordFreq.exe when attempting to execute.
